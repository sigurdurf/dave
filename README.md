# DaVe : Your savings data helper

A work in progress project.

DaVe is a savings webapp meant to simplify how you maintain overview of your savings, expenses and how much you are actually saving. Inspired by my own savings/expenses spreadsheet.

I wanted to use this project as a way to experiment with different techonlogies. The project currently uses the T3 stack since I wanted to look into prisma and trpc and to find out if I enjoy that workflow over writing api endpoints with fastapi and python. This project might include some WebAssembly in the future, since that is also something I want to look into as a way to boost performance.
